1. How can we figure out what the interquartile range is?
Answer: Interquartile range is the difference between the quartile3 (Q3) and quartile1 (Q1). First find the middle value of the entire range. then find the middle (median) value of the lower half of the range i.e Q1 (1st quartile) and similarly middle (median) value of the upper half of the range i.e Q3 (3rd quartile). 
calculating its difference will give us the IQR.

2. What exactly is the value of the 5-number theory? 
Answer: 5 number theory gives us the summary of the data. It gives the descriptive statistics of the dataset. 5 number includes minimum value, maximum value, first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2/median) and third quartile (Q3) values. 

3. What is the relationship between standard deviation and variance? 
Answer: Variance and standard deviation both gives the idea of spread of the data. Variance is the square of the standard deviation. variance = standard_deviation^2

4. What does the difference between variance and standard deviation mean? 
Answer: 

5. When is it appropriate to refer to a skewed data distribution?
